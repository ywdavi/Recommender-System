# Recommender-System
This project involves the analysis and development of a recommendation system for the BeerAdvocate platform. The goal is to create a program that suggests personalized items of interest to users based on their preferences.
Utilizing a dataset containing ratings of tens of thousands of beers, we aim to generate a tailored list of recommendations for each user, leveraging a Collaborative Filtering approach. This technique creates suggestions based on the preferences of similar users without requiring any knowledge or understanding of the product itself. Instead, it relies on user-generated ratings obtained through explicit questionnaires.
We will define the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to identify "neighboring" users and populate the sparse ratings matrix upon which recommendations will be based. Performance optimization will be conducted using a grid search to evaluate the algorithm's performance against various hyperparameters, compared through Mean Square Error (MSE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) metrics.
Additionally, we will explore the impact of Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) on performance metrics while optimizing the model's hyperparameters through grid search. Once the optimal algorithm is established, we will populate the ratings matrix, excluding real ratings, to provide users with the highest-rated beer suggestions.
Lastly, we will conduct cluster analysis using the K-Means clustering algorithm to identify distinct user groups and assess the quality of segmentation using the Silhouette coefficient to evaluate density and separation.
